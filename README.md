# Simon's Game

Simon is a game created by Ralph Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978. It was a great success during the 80s. It has a disk shape, on one of its faces you can see four quadrants, each with a color. Its name is due to well-known traditional game of the same name: Simon says, where it's inspired.

The game randomly illuminates the colored quadrants, and at the same time that it illuminates each quadrant emits its own sound. After waiting, the user must enter the sequence shown in the correct order, using his visual and audible memory. If you get it, you respond with a longer sequence, and so on. If it fails, the user must start over.
